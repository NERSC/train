Here you will find example scripts for the ATPESC IO Day Burst Buffer session. 
The scripts are well commented - see these slides for a detailed breakdown of 
how to use the burst buffer:

Note that these scripts are written under the assumption that you are using 
a training account at NERSC, and that you will be using the reservation of 
compute nodes set up for Friday 4th Aug. This is a pool of Haswell nodes 
accessible using the option "#SBATCH --reservation="atpesctrain". 
If you do not have a training account, you will not be able to access this reservation.
